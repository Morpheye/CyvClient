# CyvClient
CyvClient is a custom Minecraft 1.8.9 Parkour Client containing revamped MPKMod and MorphMPK features, as well as a range of useful mods and features used by most players.
This client performs slightly better than Forge, thus serving as an alternative to the normal MPKMod setup.

This client is currently in closed beta, a public release will come soon.

### Installation

2. Take the folder inside (should be named **CyvClient**) and place it inside your **/.minecraft/versions** folder.
3. Open up the Minecraft Launcher and create a new launcher profile.

### Updating
Download the zip file as usual, open up the folder inside and take the jar file and replace your existing CyvClient folder (in **/.minecraft/versions**) with the new one. You do not need to recreate the launcher profile.
